**Changes made by Yinqiu**

I change the line 11 from `data <- data[1:129,]` to `data <- data[4:129]`.

I also change the line 29 from `main = Correlation All covariates` to `main = Correlation Between All covariates`.

Let me know if there are something wrong! If you want any better changes, I can go back and do that!
